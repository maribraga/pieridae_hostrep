# Evolution of the Pieridae-angiosperm network

This repository contains the analyses in Braga et al. 2021 *Evolution of butterfly-plant networks over time, as revealed by Bayesian inference of host repertoire* performed in R.

- See markdown files (.md) for code and results.
- .R files of the same name have the source code. 

You can complete these analyses using the content of this repository, but to analyze your own data you have to reconstruct the host repertoire evolution in RevBayes first. The folders /inference/RevBayes-data and /inference/RevBayes-code contain the necessary files to replicate the analysis in our paper and a tutorial can be found [here](https://revbayes.github.io/tutorials/host_rep/host_rep).
